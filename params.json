{"name":"Ds","tagline":"","body":"# Data Storage (DS) library\r\n\r\n\r\nThe library is intended to serialize and de-serialize the large massive of primitives.\r\nThe data is organized as a set of named columns that allows to store heterogeneous-type matrices on the disk.\r\nThe main purpose of the library is to replace CSV format which is extremely slow.\r\n\r\n\r\nSupported data types are: Booleans, integers, floating point numbers and strings.\r\n\r\nIn order to serialize the string the dictionary is used.\r\nSo, it is quite efficient when the column of large length contains small number of different strings.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Also:\r\n 1. Data is stored in a binary format\r\n 2. Byte order swap is applied only when it is needed\r\n 3. Each column is saved in a separate file. This allows to add efficiently new columns and new rows\r\n 4. It supports conversion between ds and csv formats\r\n\r\n## Supported languages:\r\n\r\n 1. C/C++\r\n 2. Java\r\n 3. Matlab\r\n 4. More will be added\r\n\r\n\r\n## Building\r\n\r\n 1. edit cmake.config file\r\n 2. mkdir build\r\n 3. cd build\r\n 4. cmake .. \r\n 5. make \r\n 6. make install\r\n\r\n### matlab wrapper\r\nPlease enter mex directory from Matlab and then run compile.m\r\n\r\n## License\r\nAS IS, FREE for Non-Commercial usage\r\n\r\n\r\n## Site and documentations\r\nhttp://ds.temk.org/\r\n","google":"UA-43939319-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
